/**
 * An interface that can be used as a callback handler when uploader success events are fired by
 * the Uploader component.  General usage is as follows:
 * <pre>
 * uploader.setUploadSuccessHandler(new UploadSuccessHandler() {
 *    public boolean onUploadSuccess(UploadSuccessEvent event) {
 *       Window.alert("Successfully uploaded " + event.getFile().getName());
 *       return true;
 *    }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that 'uploadSuccess' is fired when the entire uploader has been transmitted and the server
 * returns a HTTP 200 status code. Any data outputted by the server is available in the server
 * data property.
 * <p>
 * At this point the uploader is not yet complete. Another uploader cannot be started from
 * uploadSuccess.
 * <p>
 * See the documentation on the {@link UploadSuccessEvent} class for more details on the data
 * available when an uploader success event occurs.
