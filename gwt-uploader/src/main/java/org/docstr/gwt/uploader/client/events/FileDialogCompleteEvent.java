/**
 * Provides access to the raw information provided by Uploader when a 'fileDialogComplete' event
 * occurs.
 * This class should not be instantiated directly, but instead you should create a {@link
 * FileDialogCompleteHandler} and
 * register it via the {@link org.docstr.gwt.uploader.client
 * .Uploader#setFileDialogCompleteHandler(FileDialogCompleteHandler)}
 * method in order to access file dialog complete events.
 * <p>
 * Note that the 'fileDialogComplete' event fires after the File Selection Dialog window has been
 * closed and all the selected files have been processed. The 'number of files queued' property
 * indicates the number of files that were queued from the dialog selection (as opposed to the
 * number of files in the queue).
 * <p>
 * If you want file uploading to begin automatically this is a good place to call {@link
 * org.docstr.gwt.uploader.client.Uploader#startUpload()}.
