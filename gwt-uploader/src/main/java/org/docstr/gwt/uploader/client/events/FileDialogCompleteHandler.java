/**
 * An interface that can be used as a callback handler when file dialog complete events are fired by
 * the Uploader component.  General usage is as follows:
 * <pre>
 * uploader.setFileDialogCompleteHandler(new FileDialogCompleteHandler() {
 *    public boolean onFileDialogComplete(FileDialogCompleteEvent event) {
 *       Window.alert(event.getTotalFilesInQueue() + " are ready to uploader");
 *       return true;
 *    }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * Note that the 'fileDialogComplete' event fires after the File Selection Dialog window has been
 * closed and all the selected files have been processed. The 'number of files queued' property
 * indicates the number of files that were queued from the dialog selection (as opposed to the
 * number of files in the queue).
 * <p>
 * If you want file uploading to begin automatically this is a good place to call {@link com
 * .jakecode.gwt.uploader.client.Uploader#startUpload()}.
 * <p>
 * See the documentation on the {@link FileDialogCompleteEvent} class for more details on the data
 * available when a file dialog complete event occurs.
