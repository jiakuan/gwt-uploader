/**
 * An interface that can be used as a callback handler when uploader completion events are fired by
 * the Uploader component.  General usage is as follows:
 * <pre>
 * uploader.setUploadCompleteHandler(new UploadCompleteHandler() {
 *    public boolean onUploadComplete(UploadCompleteEvent event) {
 *       Window.alert("Uploader complete for file " + event.getFile().getName());
 *       return true;
 *    }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that the 'uploadComplete' event is always fired at the end of an uploader cycle
 * (after uploadError or uploadSuccess). At this point the uploader is complete and another
 * uploader can be started.
 * <p>
 * If you want the next uploader to start automatically this is a good place to call this
 * .uploadStart().
 * Use caution when calling uploadStart inside the uploadComplete event if you also have code
 * that cancels all the uploads in a queue.
 * <p>
 * See the documentation on the {@link UploadCompleteEvent} class for more details on the data
 * available when an uploader complete event occurs.
