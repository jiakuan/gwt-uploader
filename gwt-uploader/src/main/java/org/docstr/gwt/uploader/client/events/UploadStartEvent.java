/**
 * Provides access to the raw information provided by Uploader when an 'uploader start' event
 * occurs.
 * This class should not be instantiated directly, but instead you should create a
 * {@link UploadStartHandler} and register it via the {@link org.docstr.gwt.uploader.client
 * .Uploader#setUploadStartHandler(UploadStartHandler)} method in order to access uploader start
 * events.
 * <p>
 * Note that the 'uploadStart' event is called immediately before the file is uploaded. This event
 * provides an opportunity to perform any last minute validation, add post params or do any other
 * work before the file is uploaded.
 * <p>
 * The uploader can be cancelled by returning 'false' from uploadStart in the handler. If you
 * return 'true' or do not return
 * any value then the uploader proceeds. Returning 'false' will cause an uploadError event to fired.
