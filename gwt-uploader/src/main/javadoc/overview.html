<body>
This library provides a means to provide sophisticated file upload capabilities within a GWT application, including
support for tracking the status, progress, and speed of each upload.  It provides file upload capabilities
via HTML5 using the "XMLHttpRequest Level 2" type APIs which to date most browsers do. 
The logical starting point is the {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.client.Uploader} class,
which provides the primary GWT widget that can be used to create a GWT Uploader instance and add it to a GWT application.
<p>
To use, first, add the jar file to your project, and include the library in the GWT xml
configuration file for your module:
<pre><code>
    &lt;inherits name="org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.Uploader"/&gt;
</code></pre>
Then, the basic usage of the API is as follows:
<pre><code>
   Uploader uploader = new Uploader()
      .setUploadURL("http://www.widgetcorp.com/uploads.php")
      .setButtonText("Click Here <span class='redText'>Yeah</span>")
      .setButtonTextStyle(".redText { color: #FF0000; }")
      .setButtonWidth(100)
      .setButtonHeight(22)
      .setButtonCursor(Upload.Cursor.HAND);
   RootPanel.get().add(upload);
</code></pre>
<p>
Please see the <a href="http://www.moxiegroup.com/moxieapps/gwt-uploader/">GWT Uploader</a> project page
for more details on how to use this library, and in particular the
<a href="http://www.moxiegroup.com/moxieapps/gwt-uploader/showcase/">demonstration applications</a> which provide
a collection of code examples that show various usage patterns.
